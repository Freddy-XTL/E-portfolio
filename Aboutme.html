            <p>
                In my early years I was so interested in the idea of technology, I fell in love with this the moment I discovered digital
                gaming. I was so curious on how everything was brought to life so I wanted to do what I love which is create software and
                one day branch into the gaming industrie if possible. I have a passion for games so that is why I am willing to take this step
                by step so that I am able to adapt to the new technology and build my dreams so that others can enjoy it too.
                When I took Computer Application Technology in grade 10 it took me into the step of the computer world when I learnt Word,
                Excel, Microsoft Access, a bit of Powerpoint and HTML. I knew that this is the path I wanted to take, the path of computing
                technology where I'll be able to create websites, web applications, software and application for the world but most importantly
                for me and what I envision the way I want to build my tech world. That's where my future was in Software Development.
